                    This was my A-Level Computer Science Coursework. Following marking of this coursework, I was told that my coursework was likely the school's highest ever computer science coursework mark.

                    This is by far my largest non-work-based project, spanning over 12 different page types. On top of this, I made all deadlines and it would be deployable with some more formal unit tests and financial infrastructure integration. However, both of these aspects were outside of the marking criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was marked for my scripting (JavaScript and PHP), rather than the visual appeal of the website. I acknowledge this area of the website needs more work and I hope to revisit the project soon.

                    This was my first group project in the world of software and it was completed over the course of roughly 3 weeks. We organised weekly meetings which all 3 members of the team were present for. I took regular lead of the development side of house whilst others found themselves better at designing the website and filling the pages with content.

                    I also undertook writing a report document up in LaTex. This is now my go-to for note taking and the report was marked fairly well. We looked carefully into accessibility, ease of use and formatting for focus retention for our users. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then concluded the project with a presentation. During this presentation, I covered a highly abstracted view of the technical aspects whilst the others discussed design aspects and the group's organisational structure.
