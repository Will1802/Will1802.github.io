            As a student, I have been given many opportunities to develop web applications. I have found myself spending most focus on backend (PHP) but am also competent as a front end dev (though I may lack in the creativity aspect of web design). I hope these projects pique your interest! Feel free contact me with any questions or requests for source code.

                    This was my A-Level Computer Science Coursework. Following marking of this coursework, I was told that my coursework was likely the school's highest ever computer science coursework mark.

                <p>
                    This is by far my largest non-work-based project, spanning over 12 different page types. On top of this, I made all deadlines and it would be deployable with some more formal unit tests and financial infrastructure integration. However, both of these aspects were outside of the marking criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was marked for my scripting (JavaScript and PHP), rather than the visual appeal of the website. I acknowledge this area of the website needs more work and I hope to revisit the project soon.

                    As part of my 1st year I worked in a group of 6 to develop a web application over the year. We decided good use of this time was to develop a game that would aim to introduce younger ages to cyber security. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided this was a good idea as demand for the industry is rapidly growing alongside the UK deficit and we found a lack of many easy and interactive resources to start learning.

                    This was my first group project in the world of software and it was completed over the course of roughly 3 weeks. We organised weekly meetings which all 3 members of the team were present for. I took regular lead of the development side of house whilst others found themselves better at designing the website and filling the pages with content.

                    I also undertook writing a report document up in LaTex. This is now my go-to for note taking and the report was marked fairly well. We looked carefully into accessibility, ease of use and formatting for focus retention for our users. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then concluded the project with a presentation. During this presentation, I covered a highly abstracted view of the technical aspects whilst the others discussed design aspects and the group's organisational structure.
